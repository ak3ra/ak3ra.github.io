I"Õ<p>So after procrastination, and switching between multiple blog platforms, I have decided to start writing again.
This blog is running on Jekyll and is sits on Github.</p>

<p>This design is inspired and adapted from  <a href="https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll"><b><i>Simply Jekyll</i></b></a>. Minor changes were made to fit my liking, specifically around fonts and color.
All credits go to ‚ÄúSimply Jekyll‚Äù</p>
