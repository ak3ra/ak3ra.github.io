I am currently a researcher at the <a href = "https://www.mila.quebec">Montreal Quebec AI Institute (MILA)</a> under the supervision of Prof. Yoshua Bengio. 

I am broadly interested in the ways we can harness Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to solving challenging problems in the real world.
