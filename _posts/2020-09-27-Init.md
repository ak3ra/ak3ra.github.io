So after procrastination, and switching between multiple blog platforms, I have decided to start writing again.
This blog is running on Jekyll and is sits on Github. 

This design is inspired and adapted from  <a href = "https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll"><b><i>Simply Jekyll</i></b></a>. Minor changes were made to fit my liking, specifically around fonts and color.
All credits go to "Simply Jekyll"
