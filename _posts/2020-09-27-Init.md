So after procrastination, and switching between multiple blog platforms, I have decided to start writing again.
This blog is running on Jekyll and is sits on Github. 

This design is inspired and adapted from  <a href = "https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll"><b><i>Simply Jekyll</i></b></a>. Minor changes were made to fit my liking, specifically around fonts and color.
All credits go to "Simply Jekyll"

<b>Init [noun]</b>: <cite> In Unix-based computer operating systems, init (short for initialization) is the first process started during booting of the computer system. Init is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down. - Wikipedia </cite>
