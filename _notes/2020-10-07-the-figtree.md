Many times we find ourselves stuck in situations where the path ahead is full of potential directions and choices beyond which we are not sure what to make. It's Like going into an ice-cream store and seeing all the flavors and being lost for choice.

I found this excerpt by Sylvia Plath very relatable, from her book "The Bell Jar"

<blockquote>“<em>I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckened and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. <br><br> I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”</em> </blockquote>

You're reading this because you made some choices, a few minutes ago, a decision was made, and multiple before that led you to read these exact words. And you could choose to stop here or continue reading along. These little choices we make (both actively and passively) are the ever spreading branches of the fig tree. It's innevitable to make these choices, and most times we don't have control of the outcomes of our decisions. Although the decisions of our present are the architects of our future, despite the uncertainy involved, it would be inadequate to sit at the base of our fig trees and watch all options wrinkle and shrink. 

Although, I must admit choosing an ice-cream flavor is such a complicated decision intense task :D
